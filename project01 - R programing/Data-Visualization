1.In which year is the engine capacity greater than the other? Does it affect horsepower? Moreover, the higher the horsepower, the more fuel consumption. 
In 2008 the engine capacity

```{r}
mpg %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(avg_displ = mean(displ)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(year), y = avg_displ)) +
  geom_col(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "Average Displacement in 1998 vs 2008",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Average Displacement") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Q2.The relationship between Displ and Cyl in an engine is that as the engine becomes larger, the number of cylinders also increases

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = cyl,color = cty)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x)+
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of Engine Displacement vs. Number of Cylinders",
       x = "Engine Displacement (liters)",
       y = "Number of Cylinders") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Q3.Which type of vehicle consumes the most fuel when driving in the city? 
It is a 2-seater car that consumes the most fuel.

```{r}
mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(class, cty), y = cty)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#705430") +
  labs(
    title = "Type Car and city miles per gallon",
    x = "Type of Cars",
    y = "City miles per gallon"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Q4.The type of power transmission or gearbox affects fuel consumption for highway miles per gallon

```{r}
mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = trans, y = hwy  ))+
  geom_boxplot(color = "#48365c") +
  labs(title = "Transmission type affects fuel efficiency, especially for highway driving",
  x = "Type of transmission",
  y = "Engine displacement") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Q5.The type of power transmission or gearbox affects fuel consumption for city miles per gallon.
```{r}
mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = trans, y = cty ))+
  geom_boxplot(color = "#5ab5cc") +
  labs(title = "Transmission type affects fuel efficiency, especially for City miles per gallon",
  x = "Type of transmission",
  y = "City miles per gallon") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Q6.The type of power transmission or gearbox has an impact on fuel consumption for both city miles per gallon and highway miles per gallon.

```{r}
mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = trans, y = cty)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = "City MPG")) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = trans, y = hwy, color = "Highway MPG")) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of City and Highway MPG Across Vehicle Classes",
       x = "Vehicle Class",
       y = "Miles Per Gallon") +
  theme_minimal()

```
